<h2>Simulating data to combat illegal fishing in R</h2>

<div class='date'> Mar 8, 2017 </div>


<p>Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is becoming a <a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004570'>major issue around the world </a>.  In general, IUU fishing is a broad term encapsulating many different scenarios (i.e. illegal: breaking laws, unreported:  Not reporting catch, which may not be illegal, Unregulated: fishing in ways or places where there are no laws).  For the purposes of this blog, we’ll just limit out discussion to Illegal fishing – i.e. fishing uses practices that are against the law, fishing in areas where it is not allowed, or taking animals which are not allowed to be taken. </p>


<p>In this blog, I'm simply going to present some code demonstrating the simulation of a training dataset. The training dataset consists of 3000 fictional ships that engage in fishing activities. We simulated ships with some of the following information: 
<ul>
<li>Five fictional countries: <strong> Sidonia, Avalon, Noordilund, Slagovnia,</strong> and <strong>Tortuga </strong> </li>
<li>Five fictional owners:  <strong> SparkleFish, FishRGud, KungFuFish, ScummyFishCo </strong> and <strong>FishARRRies </strong> </li>
<li>Five classes of ship (classed by length):<strong>  1 (60 – 100m), 2 (101 – 130m), 3 (131 – 170m), 4 (171 – 220m)</strong> and <strong>5 (221 – 300m) </strong></li>
<li>Five possible destinations of goods:<strong>  LaLaLand, BetaZed, The Shire, Alpha Centauri,</strong> and <strong>Kings Landing </strong></li>
<li>Five fish species: <strong>  <i>Raricus fishica</i>, <i>Commonae eatedie</i>, <i>Billidae nyiecus</i>, <i>Donaldus trumpfishii</i></strong> and <strong><i>Fishica maximus</i></strong> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> First, let's load up the libraries and set variables with our base categories </p>

<code>
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(reshape)
library(foreach)

Case.ship.names <- c("Jimmy Buffet", "Neil Young", "Bruce Lee", "Christian Bale", "Jolly Roger")
Case.ship.years <- c(2002, 1994, 2014, 1975, 1961)
Case.ship.types <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
Case.ship.owners <- c("SparkleFish","FishRGud","KungFuFish","ScummyFishCo","FishARRRies")
Case.ship.countries <- c("Sidonia","Avalon","Noordilund","Slagovnia","Tortuga")
Case.ship.sizes <- c(73, 104, 83, 192, 270 )
Case.ship.ShipTo <- c('LaLaLand','BetaZed','The Shire','Alpha Centauri','Kings Landing')
Fish.Species <- data.frame(species = c('Raricus Fishica','Commonae Eatedie',
                                       'Billidae Nyiecus','Donaldus Trumpfishii',
                                       'Fishica Maximus'),CitesLevel = c('2','3','2','2','3'))

</code>

<p> Create names for our 3000 ships here. We don't use ship names in our model as a factor, so we just leave these as numbers for id. We also assign each ship to a randomly selected owner. We ensure that each owner operates approximately the same number of ships to help balance classes.</p>


<code>
Ship.Id <- as.factor(c(1:3000))
owners <- sample( Case.ship.owners, 3000, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2))

</code>


<p>Next, we assign each ship to a country. However, responsible owners are more likely to be associated with countries that have stronger regulations on illegal fishing. We do this by sampling fron the country list with set probabilities for each country. In our case, we rank the countries and owners from most responsible to least responsible as such: </p>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>Most responsible </td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td>Least responsible </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Country</td>
	<td>Noordilund</td>
	<td>Sidonia</td>
	<td>Avalon</td>
	<td>Slagovnia</td>
	<td>Tortuga</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Owner</td>
	<td>SparkleFish</td>
	<td>KungFuFish</td>
	<td>FishRGud</td>
	<td>ScummyFishCo</td>
	<td>FishARRRies</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<code>
CompanyRegister <- function(owner){
  ## Responsible more owners are likely to be associated with countries that have stronger regulations on illegal fishing
  ## We set the probabilities here accordingly to reflect which countries a ship will likely be registered in  
  if(owner == "SparkleFish" ){
    country <- sample( Case.ship.countries, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05))
  }else if(owner == "FishRGud"){
    country <- sample( Case.ship.countries, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
  }else if(owner == "KungFuFish"){
    country <- sample( Case.ship.countries, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.05, 0.05))
  }else if(owner == "ScummyFishCo"){
    country <- sample( Case.ship.countries, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.025, 0.05, 0.025, 0.7, 0.2))
  }else if(owner == "FishARRRies"){
    country <- sample( Case.ship.countries, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.025, 0.05, 0.025, 0.3, 0.6))
  }
  return(country)
  
}

countries <- data.frame(sapply(owners,function(x){CompanyRegister(x)}))

</code>


<p> Next, we want to set the year that a ship was built. We make the assumption that <strong> older ships are more likely to engage in illegal fishing </strong>. To do this, we use the negative binomial distribution which will allow us to sample as a function of the owner. For example, less responsible owners (e.g., ScummyFishCo) are more likley to have older ships </p>

<code>
YearBuilt <- function(owner){
  ### Now we will assign years built as a function of the owner. 
  ### We use the negative binomial distribution to sort a skewed distribution of probabilities
  ### Sorting in ascending order (1960 - 2015) will give us newer ships
  ### Sorted in descending order (1960 - 2015) will give us older ships
  ### Changing the value of MU to higher values will bring the probability distribution closer to a uniform
  
  if(owner == "SparkleFish" ){
    ship.built <- sample(c(1960:2015),1,replace=T,prob=c(sort(rnbinom(56,mu=4,size=1000))))
  }else if(owner == "FishRGud"){
    ship.built <- sample(c(1960:2015),1,replace=T)
  }else if(owner == "KungFuFish"){
    ship.built <- sample(c(1960:2015),1,replace=T,prob=c(sort(rnbinom(56,mu=2,size=1000))))
  }else if(owner == "ScummyFishCo"){
    ship.built <- sample(c(2015:1960),1,replace=T,prob=c(sort(rnbinom(56,mu=4,size=1000))))
  }else if(owner == "FishARRRies"){
    ship.built <- sample(c(2015:1960),1,replace=T,prob=c(sort(rnbinom(56,mu=2,size=1000))))
  }
  return(ship.built)
  
}

year.constructed <- sapply(owners,function(x){YearBuilt(x)})

</code>

<p> Just a check showing the assertion that rnbinom produces the desired result </p>
<code> hist(xlab='Year',main='Histogram to pick newer ships',sample(c(1960:2015),10000,replace=T,prob=c(sort(rnbinom(56,mu=4,size=1000))))) </code>

<img src='../../img/hist_yearbuilt.jpeg' width=45% />

<p> The next step was to set the ship classes... I could have randomly assigned ship sizes across all the simulated ships, then assigned classes.. however, I wanted to operate with the assumption that <strong> classes 1 and 5 were more likely to be associated with irresponsible countries and owners. This is because we also assume that the smallest and largest ships are most likely to engage in illegal fishing </strong>. So, we rank every combination of owner and country with a score, which assigns a 'risk' value. For example, ScummyFishCo is the 4th most responsible owner, and Tortuga is the 5th most responsible country, therefore a ship owned by ScummyFishCo and registered in Tortuga would receive a score of 9.  We then use those scores to come up with probabilities that will be used to sample ship classes. </p>


<code>
## This function creates the rank (1 being least risk, 10 being most risk) in order to place ship classes with owner and country
TypeRanker <- function(owner, country, rankdf){
  ownRank <- rankdf$ranks[which(rankdf$owners == owner)]
  couRank <- rankdf$ranks[which(rankdf$countries == country)]
  Rank <- ownRank + couRank
  return(Rank)
}

## Used to generate probabilities that a class of ship is associated with an owner/country based on the rank
ProbabilityGenerator <- function(rank){
  c1andc5 <- (rank/2)/10
  c23and4 <- (1 - (c1andc5*2))/3
  pr <- c(c1andc5, c23and4,c23and4,c23and4,c1andc5) 
  return(pr)
}


### this creates a dataframe with ranks and probabilities for classing ships. 
rankCreator <- function(){
  ranks <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
  owns <- c("KungFuFish","SparkleFish","FishRGud","ScummyFishCo","FishARRRies")
  couns <- c("Noordilund","Sidonia","Avalon","Slagovnia","Tortuga")
  rankdf <- data.frame(ranks = ranks, owners = owns, countries = couns)
  ## Get every possible combination of owners and countries
  rankexpand <- expand.grid(countries=couns, owners = owns)
  Ranks <- sapply(1:nrow(rankexpand),function(x){TypeRanker(rankexpand$owners[x],rankexpand$countries[x],rankdf)})
  ### Next we subtract 1 from the rankings - this is so the probability generator can create probabilities that scale
  ### with the most responsible combinations never using high risk vessels, and the least responsible with some 
  ### probability that they may use low risk vessels. 
  
  Ranks <- Ranks - 1
  Probs <- sapply(Ranks,function(x){ProbabilityGenerator(x)})
  
  rankexpand$Ranks <- Ranks
  
  return(list(rankexpand,Probs))
}


ShipTypes <- function(owner,country,rankexpand,Probs){
  ### Now we'll assign ship types to the various owners and countries, keeping in mind that we want to make sure
  ### that the 'corrupt' companies/countries are more likely to engage in illegal fishing, AND that the largest
  ### and smallest vessels are more likely to be involved in illegal fishing
  ### We list and order the countries and owners by rank of "responsibility" 1 being most responsible,5 being least
  
  ## Which probability to use... 
  ptouse <- Probs[,which(rankexpand$countries == country & rankexpand$owners == owner)]
  ## Calculate the type of ship based on the probability
  ship.type <- sample(c(1:5),1,prob = ptouse,replace=TRUE)
  
  return(ship.type)
  
}

rankex <- rankCreator()

rankexpand <- data.frame(rankex[1])

Probs <- data.frame(rankex[2])

ship.types <- sapply(1:length(owners),function(x){ShipTypes(owner=owners[x],country = as.character(countries[x,]),rankexpand,Probs)})
  
</code>


<p> Using the ship classes, we randomly assign a size from the range of sizes within each class. As a little added noise, we make the assumption that <strong> larger ships within each class are more likely to be engaging in illegal fishing </strong> </p>

<code>
Size <- function(class,country){
  
  #### class 1 is the smallest
  #### class 5 is the largest (factory trawlers for example)
  
  if(class == 1){
    min.size <- 60
    max.size <- 100
  }else if(class==2){
    min.size <- 101
    max.size <- 130
  }else if(class==3){
    min.size <- 131
    max.size <- 170
  }else if(class==4){
    min.size <- 171
    max.size <- 220
  }else if(class==5){
    min.size <- 221
    max.size <- 300
  }
  
  ### Here, we set the relationship so that ships from countries like Sidonia and Noordilund (e.g. 'responsible countries')
  ### end up being a bit smaller on average - under our assumption that smaller ships from clean countries
  ### are less likely to fish illegally. Ships from less responsible countries will tend to be larger
  
  if(country == 'Sidonia'){
    
    mx.size.new <- max.size * 0.8
    ship.size <- floor(runif(1,min.size,mx.size.new))
    
  }else if(country == 'Avalon'){
    ## Ships from Avalon are average
    ship.size <- floor(runif(1,min.size,max.size))
    
  }else if(country == 'Noordilund'){
    mx.size.new <- max.size * 0.8
    ship.size <- floor(runif(1,min.size,mx.size.new))
    
  }else if(country == 'Slagovnia'){
    mn.size.new <- min.size * 1.2
    ship.size <- floor(runif(1,mn.size.new,max.size))
    
  }else if(country == 'Tortuga'){
    mn.size.new <- min.size * 1.2
    ship.size <- floor(runif(1,mn.size.new,max.size))
    
  }
  
  return(ship.size)
  
}


ShipSizes <- sapply(1:length(owners),function(x){Size(class = ship.types[x], country = as.character(countries[x,]))})

## now we create the dataframe
Ships <- data.frame(shipName = Ship.Id, owners = owners, countries = countries, shipType = ship.types, yearBuilt = year.constructed, shipSize = ShipSizes)


</code>

<p> Now that we have created the basic information about each of the 3000 ships, we need to create a time series for each of those ships. In other words, for each ship and every year the vessel has operated (starting in the year it was constructed), we create data by which we can train our algorithm. For every year in each ship's time series, we create data on: 
<ul>
<li>The species fished targeted that year</li>
<li>The severity of any infractions the country may have against it</li>
<li>The number of infractions an owner has against it </li>
<li>Was AIS active?</li>
<li>Where are the goods being shipped to? </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> First, we assign a species of fish targeted by each ship. But we want to assign certain rules based on the class of vessel being used, and assign probabilities of a species being assigned based on those rules. We then pull the cites level (level 2 being more restricted, level 3 being less restricted). 

<ul>
<li>Rule 1)  Raricus Fishica can only be fished by class 4 and 5 vessels</li>
<li>Rule 2)  Commonae Eatedie are taken by all classes</li>
<li>Rule 4)  Billidae Nyiecus looks a lot like another species which is illegal to catch, and is only ever caught by Class 1 vessels </li>
<li>Rule 5)  Donaldus Trumpfishii is somewhat rare, can only be targeted by class 2 and 3 vessels</li>
<li>Rule 6)  Fishica Maximus is very common and taken only by class 5 vessels</li>
</ul>
</p>

<code>
Shipdata$species <- sapply(Shipdata$shipType, function(x){
  if(x == 5){
    Fish <- sample(Fish.Species$species, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6,0.1,0,0,0.3))
  }else if(x == 4){
    Fish <- sample(Fish.Species$species, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5,0,0,0))
  }else if(x == 3){
    Fish <- sample(Fish.Species$species, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0,0.5,0,0.5,0))
  }else if(x == 2){
    Fish <- sample(Fish.Species$species, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0,0.5,0,0.5,0))
  }else if(x == 1){
    Fish <- sample(Fish.Species$species, 1, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0,0.3,0.7,0,0))
  }
  
})

Shipdata$cites <- sapply(Shipdata$species, function(x){return(Fish.Species$CitesLevel[which(Fish.Species$species == x)])})

</code>

<p> I then created the time series for each ship by expanding the dataframe for each ship from the year it was constructed to 2016 (i.e. if it was constructed in 1976, the time series would have n = 40) </p>

<code>
### Calculates the number of years active which we use to expand the table to add the year on the dataset
PresentYear <- 2017
Shipdata$totyears <- (PresentYear - Shipdata$yearBuilt) - 1
## We subtract 1 here to make sure we aren't added 2017 as the latest year
Shipdata <- data.frame(Shipdata)

#Expand the table to add the time series (year) data
Shipexpand <-untable(Shipdata[,c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)], num=Shipdata[,9])


### Expands the data to create time series

Train1 <- foreach(k = unique(Shipexpand$shipName), .combine='rbind') %do% {
  cat(k,'\n')
  A <- Shipexpand[which(Shipexpand$shipName == k),]
  A$Years <- sapply(1:nrow(A), function(x){A$yearBuilt[x] + x}) 
  return(A)
}

</code>

<p> I next created a data frame which tells us if a country has a 'flag' against it and when it was obtained.. a value of 99999 means no flag has been given.</p>

<code>
C.flagged <- data.frame(countries = Case.ship.countries, yearflagged = c(2005,1994,99999,1972,1962),severity=c(1,1,0,2,2))

### Get the severity flags for the countries
Train2 <- foreach(k = unique(Train1$shipName),.combine='rbind') %do% {
  cat(k,'\n')
  Dat <- Train1[which(Train1$shipName == k),]  
  Dat$countryFlag <- Flagged(C.flagged,Dat)
  return(Dat)
  
}
</code>

<p> We do something similar with the owners, except instead of severity, we use the number of infractions (flags) against an owner </p>

<code>
O.flagged <- data.frame(owners = Case.ship.owners, numflags = c(1,5,1,14,20))
SFflags <- c(1991)
SFflagcount <- c(1)
FGflags <- c(1991,1994,1999,2002,2004)
FGflagcount <- c(1:length(FGflags))
KFflags <- c(1982)
KFflagcount <- c(1:length(KFflags))
SCflags <- c(1962,1971,1972,1975,1980,1982,1983,1984,1991,1992,1995,1999,2000,2007)
SCflagcount <- c(1:length(SCflags))
FAflags <- c(1961,1963,1964,1965,1968,1970,1972,1975,1977,1980,1984,1989,1992,1994,1999,2000,2004,2005,2007,2010)
FAflagcount <- c(1:length(FAflags))

O.expand <-untable(O.flagged[,c(1,2)], num=O.flagged[,2])
O.expand$flagged <- c(SFflags,FGflags,KFflags,SCflags,FAflags)
O.expand$flagcount <- c(SFflagcount,FGflagcount,KFflagcount,SCflagcount,FAflagcount)

### Place the flags in for the owners
Train3 <- foreach(k = unique(Train2$shipName),.combine='rbind') %do% {
  cat(k,'\n')
  Dat <- Train2[which(Train2$shipName == k),]  
  Dat$Num.O.flags <- OFlagged(O.expand,Dat)
  
  return(Dat)
  
}

</code>


<p>Next we simulate if a ship had on it's WMS / AIS system during the fish. In reality, this would be hard to tell - the WMS/AIS system needs to be linked to the database. We'll do this as a function of owner, country, and fish species. We'll set this as the probability that the AIS is ON (or 1) </p>

<code>
ownsprobs <- data.frame(owners = c("KungFuFish","SparkleFish","FishRGud","ScummyFishCo","FishARRRies"),Probs = c(5,4,3,2,1))
counprobs <- data.frame(countries = c("Noordilund","Sidonia","Avalon","Slagovnia","Tortuga"),Probs = c(5,4,3,2,1))
fishprobs <- data.frame(species = c('Raricus Fishica','Commonae Eatedie','Billidae Nyiecus','Donaldus Trumpfishii',
                                       'Fishica Maximus'),Probs = c(1,5,2,3,4))
## 15 is the maximum value, so we'll subtract the additive probability from 18 (to make some wiggle room for the possibility that
## a situation where 15 comes up does not always get assigned an AIS ON (1))

Train3$AIS <- sapply(1:nrow(Train3),function(x){
  owner <- Train3$owners[x]
  country <- Train3$country[x]
  fish <- Train3$species[x]
  ProbAIS <- ownsprobs$Probs[which(ownsprobs$owners == owner)]+
    counprobs$Probs[which(counprobs$countries == country)]+
    fishprobs$Probs[which(fishprobs$species == fish)]
  ProbNoAIS <- 18 - ProbAIS
  
  AIS <- sample(c(0,1),1,prob=c(ProbNoAIS,ProbAIS))
  
})
</code>

<p> Before assigning the response variable, we need to assign values for where the goods are being shipped. We assign the ship-to location randomly. However, we want to also program in situations where a ship changes ship to locations, which is <strong>indicative of a higher likelihood of illegal activity </strong> in our dataset.</p>

<code>
ShipTo <- c('LaLaLand','Alpha Centauri','BetaZed','The Shire','Kings Landing')

seed <- 1
Train4 <- foreach(k = unique(Train3$shipName), .combine='rbind') %do% {
  Dat <- data.frame(Train3[which(Train3$shipName == k),])
  EndPoint <- sample(ShipTo,1)
  Dat$ShipTo <- rep(EndPoint,nrow(Dat))
  seed <- seed+1
  return(Dat)
}

### Now we make it so a few of the high risk operators/owners and fish species end up sometimes changing shipto locations

Train4$ShipSwitch <- rep(0,nrow(Train4))
Train5 <- foreach(k = unique(Train4$shipName), .combine='rbind',.errorhandling='stop') %do% {
  cat(k,'\n')
  Dat <- Train4[which(Train4$shipName == k),]
  if(unique(Dat$owners) == "ScummyFishCo" | unique(Dat$owners) == "FishARRRies" ){
  Samp <- sample(c(1:10),1,replace=T)
    if(Samp > 5){
      if(unique(Dat$species)=='Raricus Fishica' | unique(Dat$species)=='Billidae Nyiecus'){
        rows <- sample(c(1:nrow(Dat)),2,replace=T)
        Dat$ShipTo[rows[1]] <- sample(ShipTo,1,replace=T)
        Dat$ShipTo[rows[2]] <- sample(ShipTo,1,replace=T)
        ## We do this for reference for creating our dataset
        Dat$ShipSwitch[rows[1]] <- 1
        Dat$ShipSwitch[rows[2]] <- 1

          
      }
    }
  }
  return(Dat)
}
</code>


<h3> Assigning values for the response variable </h3>

<p> all in all, we have ten assumptions that we want to use here:

<ul>
<li>Assumption 1) The largest (class 5) and smallest (class 1) vessels are slightly more likely to engage in illegal fishing. This will help to create a bimodal distribution of the ship sizes engaging in illegal activities to demonstrate the non-parametric nature of the algorithm</li>
<li>Assumption 2) "responsible" countries with strong Illegal fishing laws are less likely to engage in illegal fishing. In our dataset, Sidonia and Noordilund are countries with strong regulations, Avalon is in the middle and Slagovnia and Tortuga have either little or no regulation</li>
<li>Assumption 3) Companies with sustainable practices will almost never engage in illegal fisheries. In our example, SparkleFish, and KungFuFish are the most sustainable, FishRGud are moderate, while ScummyFishCo and FishARRRies are the least sustainable</li>
<li>Assumption 4) Older fishing vessels are more likely to engage in illegal fisheries as they are more likely to be used by organizations wanting to cut costs and not prioritize safety features to save money (these are organizations likely to be more corrupt)</li>
<li>Assumption 5) RaricusFishica is likely to be illegally caught the most.. but BillidaeNyiecus looks like another species therefore we score it higher as there could be illegal fishing associated with it </li>
<li>Assumption 6) Cites level 2 are more likely to be associated with illegal fishing</li>
<li>Assumption 7) More flags by the owner increases likelihood a vessel is fishing illegally</li>
<li>Assumption 8) If a country has been flagged, illegal fishing is more likely</li>
<li>Assumption 9) If a ship has switched its trade route, it is more likely to be fishing illegally</li>
<li>Assumption 10) If ship does not have on AIS, it is more likely to be fishing illegally</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p> Based on our assumptions, we will score each class or variable with higher values indicating a higher probability of illegal fishing. Those score will be added across rows for each of the variables, and the score will determine the probability that a ship is engaging in illegal fishing.  <i><strong>NOTE</strong> We set these scores somewhat arbitrarily here in order to strengthen the patterns so when we model this (in an upcoming blog), they are picked out</i> </p>

<p> All of these data and the code can be accessed at the <a href='https://github.com/Blackbawks/IllegalFishing'> Github page </a>. These data are used as the training set for a Shiny application that you can find at: <a href='https://grwhumphries.shinyapps.io/iuushiny/'> https://grwhumphries.shinyapps.io/iuushiny/ </a>.  The goal of this beign to highlight how machine learning applications can be used for decision support in the fight against illegal fishing </p>.
